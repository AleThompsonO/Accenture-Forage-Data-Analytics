# Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience

This repository contains my work for the [Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Experience](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience) on Forage.

In this virtual experience, I completed tasks related to data analytics and visualization, including data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and storytelling. I gained practical skills and experience from Accenture North America and deep-dived into the evolving world of data from an analytics and visualization perspective.

Upon completion, I was equipped with data fundamentals and an understanding of what a career in data analytics could look like.

I invite you to explore my work in this repository and learn more about the virtual experience on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/hzmoNKtzvAzXsEqx8/Data-Analytics-Virtual-Experience).
